# HW 2: Hello Hello Hello!

Follow these steps to get your project ready to work on:

1. `cd` into  the directory you will work in (e.g., <669dir>/hw2)
2. clone this repo into your hw2 directory
3. cd into the new directory (e.g., `$ cd hw2-hello-numerator`)
4. create a new expo project called "hw2Hello" (`$ expo init hw2Hello`)
5. cd into the expo project directory (`$ cd hw2Hello`)
6. remove the `.git` directory that is created by expo init (`$ rm -rf .git`). Make sure you do this in the `hw2Hello` diretory and NOT in the directory that was cloned from GitHub.
7. start working on your project

You will start with a blank app, and your job is to modify it to look like this:
